## Prerequisites

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install). 

    - On OSX : use [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) which will provide you both `docker` and `docker-compose`.
        - Docker Sync : Sync between host source files and container can be painfully slow on OSX. We advise you to install [docker-sync](http://docker-sync.io/) to speed things up.

    - On Linux : follow [the instructions for your distribution](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). `docker-compose` must be be installed independently.
